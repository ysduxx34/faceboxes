# Pedestrain Detect Use Faceboxes
[faceBoxes: a cpu real-time face detector with hight accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05234)  

Faceboxes is a SSD style object detector, it is designed for fast face detect, has a lightweight yet powerful network structure.

## Come From

I forked from (https://github.com/xiongzihua/faceboxes)

## Done
1. Modified some codes to train on wider pedestrain dataset(https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19118).

## TODO
1. Sheer Net and run it on mobile devices.

## Other info
pytorch 0.4
